If you ever worked with environment variables in a TypeScript project, you probably know that it can be a bit of a pain to handle them.

How many times you had to write something like this?

```typescript
const PORT = process.env.PORT as string;
```

Every time you access an environment variable, you have to cast it to the correct type. This is not only error-prone but also makes your code harder to read and maintain, especially when having lot of environment variables.

This is where Zod comes in. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows you to define the types for your environment variables and parse them from the environment in a single step. Let's see how it works.
