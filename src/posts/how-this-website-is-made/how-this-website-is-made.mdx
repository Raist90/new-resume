### As a fullstack developer I spend a lot of time working with Next, React and Typescript.

I also have been using Sanity as a headless CMS for a while now and I really like it. It is easy to use and I think it has a great developer experience.
In fact almost all of this website content is served from Sanity, exception made for the blog posts. I know what you are thinking, why not use Sanity for the blog posts as well? It is a CMS after all, right?

Well, I did that because all posts are written in markdown and I wanted to keep it that way. I like markdown and I think it is a great way to write content. I also like the idea of having all my content in a git repository. I can easily edit it, I can easily move it to another platform if I want to and I can easily share it with others.

Does Next support markdown out of the box? Well, let's say it wasn't a breeze to work with. I had to write a lot of code to make it work the way I wanted, but I'm pretty satisfied with the result and I think I will soon publish a guide on how to do it properly (especially since I haven't found a good one updated with Next *App Router* changes).

Another reason why I didn't use Sanity or another CMS for this is because I really enjoy writing markdown inside *NeoVim* and I wanted to keep doing that.
