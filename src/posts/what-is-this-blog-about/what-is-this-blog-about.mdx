This blog is about my journey as a developer. I will write about the things I learn, the things I build and the things I think about. 

As a developer I am interested in many things. I am interested in the frontend, the backend, devops, design, product management and many others.

I have built this blog from scratch using Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind CSS. I really enjoy this stack and I will write about it in the future.

I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I enjoy writing it.
